# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

In this assignement I created the back end for a note taker app. I used express to build out this project. This project gave me problems because it was poorly documented and what was asked of us was really vague. I also had issues using a wildcard in my routes. Once express finds a wildcard it stops looking for other valid paths, so the get route I was using to recall saved notes was being caught be the wildcard.
